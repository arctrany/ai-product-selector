# ADR-001: Module Architecture Pattern
ADR_001_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-001: Adopt Modular Architecture with SOLID Principles",
    status="Accepted",
    context="""
    The original src/playwright system had several architectural issues:
    - Monolithic design with tight coupling between components
    - Difficult to test individual components in isolation
    - Hard to extend or modify specific functionality
    - No clear separation of concerns
    - Limited reusability of components
    
    We needed to redesign the system to be more maintainable, testable, and extensible.
    """,
    decision="""
    We decided to adopt a modular architecture based on SOLID principles:
    
    1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
       - Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
       - BrowserDriver: Browser lifecycle management
       - DOMAnalyzer: Page content analysis
       - Paginator: Pagination handling
       - ConfigManager: Configuration management
       - LoggerSystem: Logging and monitoring
    
    2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
       - Modules are open for extension but closed for modification
       - Abstract base classes define interfaces
       - Concrete implementations can be swapped without affecting other modules
    
    3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
       - All implementations of an interface are interchangeable
       - Any BrowserDriver implementation can be used with any DOMAnalyzer
    
    4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
       - Interfaces are focused and specific to client needs
       - No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use
    
    5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
       - High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
       - Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)
       - Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded
    """,
    consequences="""
    Positive:
    - Improved testability through dependency injection and interface-based design
    - Better maintainability with clear separation of concerns
    - Enhanced extensibility - new implementations can be added easily
    - Reduced coupling between components
    - Better code reusability across different scenarios
    
    Negative:
    - Increased initial complexity due to abstraction layers
    - More files and classes to manage
    - Potential performance overhead from abstraction (minimal in practice)
    - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with SOLID principles
    """,
    alternatives=[
        "Keep monolithic architecture - rejected due to maintenance issues",
        "Use microservices architecture - overkill for this use case",

# ADR-002: Async/Await Pattern
ADR_002_ASYNC_PATTERN = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-002: Use Async/Await Pattern for All I/O Operations",
    status="Accepted",
    context="""
    Browser automation involves many I/O operations:
    - Network requests for page loading
    - DOM queries and manipulations
    - File I/O for configuration and logging
    - Database operations (potential future requirement)
    
    The original system used synchronous operations, leading to:
    - Poor performance when handling multiple pages
    - Blocking operations that freeze the entire process
    - Inability to handle concurrent operations efficiently
    """,
    decision="""
    We decided to use Python's async/await pattern throughout the system:
    
    1. All I/O operations are asynchronous
    2. All public methods that perform I/O are async
    3. Use asyncio for concurrency management
    4. Playwright's async API is used instead of sync API
    5. Configuration loading remains synchronous (one-time operation)
    6. Logging operations are asynchronous to avoid blocking
    """,
    consequences="""
    Positive:
    - Significantly improved performance for concurrent operations
    - Better resource utilization
    - Non-blocking I/O operations
    - Scalability for handling multiple pages/sessions
    - Future-ready for high-concurrency scenarios
    
    Negative:
    - Increased complexity in code structure
    - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with async programming
    - Potential for async/await propagation throughout the codebase
    - Debugging async code can be more challenging
    - Need to be careful about blocking operations in async context
    """,
    alternatives=[
        "Synchronous operations - rejected due to performance issues",

# ADR-003: Configuration Management Strategy
ADR_003_CONFIG_STRATEGY = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-003: Multi-Format Configuration with Hierarchical Scopes",
    status="Accepted",
    context="""
    The system needs flexible configuration management to support:
    - Different deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
    - Various configuration formats preferred by different teams
    - Runtime configuration updates
    - Configuration validation and error handling
    - Environment variable overrides
    
    The original system had limited configuration options and was hard to customize.
    """,
    decision="""
    We implemented a multi-format configuration system with:
    
    1. Format Support:
       - JSON (primary format)
       - YAML (for human-readable configs)
       - TOML (for complex configurations)
       - INI (for legacy compatibility)
       - Environment variables (for deployment)
    
    2. Hierarchical Scopes:
       - Global configuration
       - Module-specific scopes (browser, dom_analysis, pagination, logging)
       - Runtime overrides
    
    3. Features:
       - Auto-detection of configuration format
       - Configuration validation against schema
       - Environment variable substitution
       - Runtime configuration updates
       - Configuration merging and inheritance
    """,
    consequences="""
    Positive:
    - Flexibility to use preferred configuration formats
    - Easy environment-specific configuration
    - Strong validation prevents configuration errors
    - Runtime updates allow dynamic behavior changes
    - Clear separation of concerns with scoped configuration
    
    Negative:
    - Increased complexity in configuration management code
    - Multiple formats to maintain and document
    - Potential confusion about which format to use
    - Schema maintenance overhead

# ADR-004: Error Handling and Logging Strategy
ADR_004_ERROR_LOGGING = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-004: Structured Logging with Performance Monitoring",
    status="Accepted",
    context="""
    Browser automation systems need comprehensive logging for:
    - Debugging complex automation failures
    - Performance monitoring and optimization
    - Audit trails for compliance
    - Operational monitoring in production
    - Error tracking and alerting
    
    The original system had basic logging that was difficult to analyze and lacked
    performance insights.
    """,
    decision="""
    We implemented a structured logging system with:
    
    1. Structured Logging:
       - JSON format for machine readability
       - Consistent log schema across all modules
       - Contextual information (page_id, operation, timing)
       - Multiple output destinations (console, file, future: external systems)
    
    2. Performance Monitoring:
       - Built-in performance tracking for all operations
       - Automatic timing of async operations
       - Memory usage monitoring
       - Custom metrics collection
    
    3. Error Handling:
       - Hierarchical exception classes
       - Detailed error context
       - Automatic error logging with stack traces
       - Graceful degradation where possible
    
    4. Log Management:
       - Log rotation to prevent disk space issues

# ADR-005: Testing Strategy
ADR_005_TESTING_STRATEGY = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-005: Comprehensive Testing with Multiple Test Types",
    status="Accepted",

    Browser automation systems are complex and prone to various types of failures:
    - Network issues and timeouts
    - DOM structure changes
    - Browser compatibility issues
    - Configuration errors
    - Performance regressions
    
    The original system had minimal testing, making it difficult to ensure reliability
    and catch regressions during development.
    """,
    decision="""
    We implemented a comprehensive testing strategy with multiple test types:
    
    1. Unit Tests:
       - Test individual components in isolation
       - Mock external dependencies (browser, network)
       - High coverage (>90%) of core functionality
       - Fast execution for rapid feedback
    
    2. Integration Tests:
       - Test component interactions
       - Verify configuration propagation
       - Test error handling across modules
       - Validate async operation coordination
    
    3. End-to-End Tests:
       - Test complete workflows
       - Simulate real-world scenarios (e-commerce scraping)

# ADR-006: Dependency Management
ADR_006_DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT = ArchitectureDecision(
    title="ADR-006: Minimal External Dependencies with Clear Abstractions",
    status="Accepted",
    context="""
    Browser automation systems often have complex dependency chains that can lead to:
    - Version conflicts and dependency hell
    - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
    - Maintenance burden from frequent updates
    - Deployment complexity
    - Vendor lock-in to specific tools
    
    We needed to balance functionality with maintainability and security.
    """,
    decision="""
    We adopted a minimal dependency approach with clear abstractions:
    
    1. Core Dependencies:
       - Playwright: Browser automation (well-maintained, actively developed)
       - asyncio: Built-in Python async support
       - Standard library: JSON, logging, pathlib, etc.
    
    2. Optional Dependencies:
       - PyYAML: YAML configuration support (optional)
       - toml: TOML configuration support (optional)
       - coverage: Test coverage analysis (dev only)
    
    3. Abstraction Strategy:
       - Abstract interfaces hide dependency details
       - Easy to swap implementations (e.g., Selenium instead of Playwright)
       - Dependency injection allows runtime selection
       - Clear separation between core logic and external tools
    
    4. Version Management:
       - Pin major versions for stability
       - Regular security updates

    - Concurrent operations need careful management
    
    Performance is critical for production deployments and user experience.
    """,
