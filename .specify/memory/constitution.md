# AI Product Selector Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Architecture
Every feature leverages AI capabilities as the primary intelligence layer. All product selection logic must be driven by machine learning models and intelligent algorithms. Traditional rule-based approaches are supplementary only.

### II. User-Centric Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features must prioritize user experience and provide clear value to end users. Every interface must be intuitive, responsive, and provide meaningful feedback. User testing and feedback loops are mandatory before feature completion.

### III. Data-Driven Decisions
All product recommendations must be based on quantifiable data and metrics. Features must include analytics and performance tracking. Decision logic must be transparent and auditable.

### IV. Spring AI Alibaba Integration
All AI functionality must leverage Spring AI Alibaba framework for consistency and maintainability. Custom AI implementations require architectural review and approval.

### V. Scalability & Performance
System must handle concurrent users efficiently. All AI operations must have reasonable response times (<3 seconds for recommendations). Caching strategies required for frequently accessed data.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Spring AI Alibaba integration mandatory
- **Database**: Support for both relational (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and vector databases
- **AI Models**: Alibaba Cloud AI services as primary, with fallback strategies
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
- **Testing**: Unit tests (>80% coverage) and integration tests required

### Security & Compliance
- All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- AI model inputs/outputs must be logged for audit purposes
- Rate limiting required for all public APIs
- User consent required for data collection and AI processing

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates
- All features must pass automated tests before merge
- Code review required by at least one senior developer
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained or improved
- AI model accuracy metrics must be documented and tracked

### Documentation Requirements
- All AI models must have performance metrics documented
- API endpoints must have complete OpenAPI documentation
- User-facing features require user guide updates

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code reviews and feature implementations must verify compliance with these principles.

**Amendments**: Changes to this constitution require team consensus and documentation of migration impact.

**Enforcement**: Non-compliance issues must be addressed before feature completion.
