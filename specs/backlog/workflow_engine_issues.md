# Workflow Engine Issues Backlog

## Overview
This backlog tracks potential design and performance issues identified in the workflow engine implementation. These issues were discovered during code analysis and impact reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Checkpoint Persistence
- **Issue**: The engine disables LangGraph's checkpointing mechanism (`self.checkpointer = None`)
- **Impact**: Workflow progress is lost if the server restarts during execution
- **Location**: `core/engine.py` line 28
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Open

### 2. Incomplete Interrupt Handling
- **Issue**: The interrupt mechanism raises an undefined `InterruptedError` exception and doesn't properly integrate with LangGraph's pause/resume functionality
- **Impact**: Pause/resume functionality is unreliable or non-functional
- **Location**: `core/engine.py` in `_create_python_node_handler` method, lines 129-135
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Open

### 3. Race Conditions in State Management
- **Issue**: Non-atomic status updates and signal processing without synchronization
- **Impact**: Could lead to race conditions and inconsistent workflow states
- **Location**: `storage/database.py` in `update_run_status` and `get_pending_signals` methods
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Open

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Inefficient Database Queries
- **Issue**: Multiple methods perform inefficient queries without proper indexing considerations, including N+1 query problems
- **Impact**: Slower workflow startup and execution times
- **Location**: `storage/database.py` methods like `get_data_retention_stats`
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Open

### 5. Synchronous Operations
- **Issue**: The engine uses synchronous operations which block execution during potentially long-running workflows
- **Impact**: Poor scalability when running multiple concurrent workflows
- **Location**: `core/engine.py` in `start_workflow` method
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Open

### 6. Global State Issues
- **Issue**: Uses a global `_FUNCTION_REGISTRY` that could cause conflicts in multi-process environments
- **Impact**: Unpredictable behavior when multiple workflows run concurrently
- **Location**: `core/registry.py` line 11
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Open

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Tight Coupling
- **Issue**: The engine is tightly coupled to specific database paths and configurations
- **Impact**: Makes it difficult to test and deploy in different environments
- **Location**: Throughout `core/engine.py`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open

### 8. Inconsistent Session Management
- **Issue**: SQLAlchemy sessions are not consistently handled, potentially causing connection leaks
- **Impact**: Could exhaust database connections during long operations
- **Location**: `storage/database.py` various methods
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open

### 9. Dynamic Import Complexity
- **Issue**: Complex fallback logic for dynamic imports that could fail silently
- **Impact**: Functions might not be registered properly, leading to runtime errors
- **Location**: `apps/manager.py` in `load_workflow_definition` method
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open

## Low Priority Issues

### 10. Security Concerns
- **Issue**: Potential for dangerous imports and dependency installations without proper validation
- **Impact**: Possible security vulnerabilities
- **Location**: `core/registry.py` in `install_dependencies` function
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open

### 11. Insufficient Validation
- **Issue**: No validation of input parameters or workflow states
- **Impact**: Could lead to invalid states and unpredictable behavior
- **Location**: Throughout `core/engine.py`
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open

### 12. Missing Documentation
- **Issue**: Inadequate documentation for complex operations and error handling
- **Impact**: Makes maintenance and debugging difficult
- **Location**: Throughout the workflow engine
- **Priority**: Low
- **Status**: Open

## Resolution Strategy

1. **Immediate (Sprint 1)**: Address critical issues #1-3 to ensure basic functionality
2. **Short-term (Sprint 2)**: Tackle high priority issues #4-6 to improve performance
3. **Medium-term (Sprint 3)**: Work on medium priority issues #7-9 to improve maintainability
4. **Long-term (Sprint 4+)**: Address remaining issues to improve security and documentation

## Definition of Done
- Issues are fixed with appropriate unit tests
- Performance benchmarks show improvement
- All critical and high priority issues are resolved
- Code review is completed by team members
- Integration tests pass successfully

## Refactor Plan
A comprehensive refactor plan has been created to address these issues systematically. See [workflow_engine_refactor_plan.md](workflow_engine_refactor_plan.md) for detailed implementation approach, timeline, and success metrics.

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1: Critical Stability Fixes** - Addresses checkpoint persistence, interrupt handling, and race conditions
2. **Phase 2: Performance Improvements** - Optimizes database queries and implements async operations
3. **Phase 3: Architecture Improvements** - Implements proper dependency injection and thread safety
4. **Phase 4: Security Enhancements** - Adds input validation and secure import mechanisms

### Success Metrics
- Database query performance improvement > 50%
- Workflow execution speed improvement > 30%
- Memory usage reduction > 20%
- Concurrent workflow capacity increase > 100%
