BrowserType
BrowserType provides methods to launch a specific browser instance or connect to an existing one. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

Sync
Async
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

def run(playwright: Playwright):
chromium = playwright.chromium
browser = chromium.launch()
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://example.com")
# other actions...
browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
run(playwright)

Methods
connect
Added before v1.9
This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance created via BrowserType.launchServer in Node.js.

note
The major and minor version of the Playwright instance that connects needs to match the version of Playwright that launches the browser (1.2.3 â†’ is compatible with 1.2.x).

Usage

browser_type.connect(ws_endpoint)
browser_type.connect(ws_endpoint, **kwargs)

Arguments

ws_endpoint str Added in: v1.10#

A Playwright browser websocket endpoint to connect to. You obtain this endpoint via BrowserServer.wsEndpoint.

expose_network str (optional) Added in: v1.37#

This option exposes network available on the connecting client to the browser being connected to. Consists of a list of rules separated by comma.

Available rules:

Hostname pattern, for example: example.com, *.org:99, x.*.y.com, *foo.org.
IP literal, for example: 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0:99, [::1], [0:0::1]:99.
<loopback> that matches local loopback interfaces: localhost, *.localhost, 127.0.0.1, [::1].
Some common examples:

"*" to expose all network.
"<loopback>" to expose localhost network.
"*.test.internal-domain,*.staging.internal-domain,<loopback>" to expose test/staging deployments and localhost.
headers Dict[str, str] (optional) Added in: v1.11#

Additional HTTP headers to be sent with web socket connect request. Optional.

slow_mo float (optional) Added in: v1.10#

Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.

timeout float (optional) Added in: v1.10#

Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to 0 (no timeout).

Returns

Browser#
connect_over_cdp
Added in: v1.9
This method attaches Playwright to an existing browser instance using the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

The default browser context is accessible via browser.contexts.

note
Connecting over the Chrome DevTools Protocol is only supported for Chromium-based browsers.

note
This connection is significantly lower fidelity than the Playwright protocol connection via browser_type.connect(). If you are experiencing issues or attempting to use advanced functionality, you probably want to use browser_type.connect().

Usage

Sync
Async
browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://localhost:9222")
default_context = browser.contexts[0]
page = default_context.pages[0]

Arguments

endpoint_url str Added in: v1.11#

A CDP websocket endpoint or http url to connect to. For example http://localhost:9222/ or ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/387adf4c-243f-4051-a181-46798f4a46f4.

headers Dict[str, str] (optional) Added in: v1.11#

Additional HTTP headers to be sent with connect request. Optional.

slow_mo float (optional) Added in: v1.11#

Slows down Playwright operations by the specified amount of milliseconds. Useful so that you can see what is going on. Defaults to 0.

timeout float (optional) Added in: v1.11#

Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the connection to be established. Defaults to 30000 (30 seconds). Pass 0 to disable timeout.

Returns

Browser#
launch
Added before v1.9
Returns the browser instance.

Usage

You can use ignore_default_args to filter out --mute-audio from default arguments:

Sync
Async
browser = playwright.chromium.launch( # or "firefox" or "webkit".
ignore_default_args=["--mute-audio"]
)

Chromium-only Playwright can also be used to control the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, but it works best with the version of Chromium it is bundled with. There is no guarantee it will work with any other version. Use executable_path option with extreme caution.

If Google Chrome (rather than Chromium) is preferred, a Chrome Canary or Dev Channel build is suggested.

Stock browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are suitable for tests that require proprietary media codecs for video playback. See this article for other differences between Chromium and Chrome. This article describes some differences for Linux users.

Arguments

args List[str] (optional)#

warning
Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.

Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found here.

channel str (optional)#

Browser distribution channel.

Use "chromium" to opt in to new headless mode.

Use "chrome", "chrome-beta", "chrome-dev", "chrome-canary", "msedge", "msedge-beta", "msedge-dev", or "msedge-canary" to use branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

chromium_sandbox bool (optional)#

Enable Chromium sandboxing. Defaults to false.

devtools bool (optional)#

Deprecated
Use debugging tools instead.

Chromium-only Whether to auto-open a Developer Tools panel for each tab. If this option is true, the headless option will be set false.

Specify environment variables that will be visible to the browser. Defaults to process.env.

executable_path Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#

Path to a browser executable to run instead of the bundled one. If executable_path is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory. Note that Playwright only works with the bundled Chromium, Firefox or WebKit, use at your own risk.

firefox_user_prefs Dict[str, str | float | bool] (optional)#

Firefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences at about:config.

You can also provide a path to a custom policies.json file via PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_POLICIES_JSON environment variable.

traces_dir Union[str, pathlib.Path] (optional)#

If specified, traces are saved into this directory.

Returns

Browser#
launch_persistent_context
Added before v1.9
Returns the persistent browser context instance.

Launches browser that uses persistent storage located at user_data_dir and returns the only context. Closing this context will automatically close the browser.

Usage

browser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir)
browser_type.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir, **kwargs)

Arguments

user_data_dir Union[str, pathlib.Path]#

Path to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage. Pass an empty string to create a temporary directory.

More details for Chromium and Firefox. Chromium's user data directory is the parent directory of the "Profile Path" seen at chrome://version.

Note that browsers do not allow launching multiple instances with the same User Data Directory.

warning
Chromium/Chrome: Due to recent Chrome policy changes, automating the default Chrome user profile is not supported. Pointing userDataDir to Chrome's main "User Data" directory (the profile used for your regular browsing) may result in pages not loading or the browser exiting. Create and use a separate directory (for example, an empty folder) as your automation profile instead. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port for details.

accept_downloads bool (optional)#

Whether to automatically download all the attachments. Defaults to true where all the downloads are accepted.

args List[str] (optional)#

warning
Use custom browser args at your own risk, as some of them may break Playwright functionality.

Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance. The list of Chromium flags can be found here.

base_url str (optional)#

When using page.goto(), page.route(), page.wait_for_url(), page.expect_request(), or page.expect_response() it takes the base URL in consideration by using the URL() constructor for building the corresponding URL. Unset by default. Examples:

baseURL: http://localhost:3000 and navigating to /bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/bar.html
baseURL: http://localhost:3000/foo/ and navigating to ./bar.html results in http://localhost:3000/foo/bar.html

Passphrase for the private key (PEM or PFX).

TLS Client Authentication allows the server to request a client certificate and verify it.

Details

An array of client certificates to be used. Each certificate object must have either both certPath and keyPath, a single pfxPath, or their corresponding direct value equivalents (cert and key, or pfx). Optionally, passphrase property should be provided if the certificate is encrypted. The origin property should be provided with an exact match to the request origin that the certificate is valid for.

Client certificate authentication is only active when at least one client certificate is provided. If you want to reject all client certificates sent by the server, you need to provide a client certificate with an origin that does not match any of the domains you plan to visit.

note
When using WebKit on macOS, accessing localhost will not pick up client certificates. You can make it work by replacing localhost with local.playwright.

color_scheme "light" | "dark" | "no-preference" | "null" (optional)#
